	ECCO has many use cases:

	<ul>
	<li>Consolidating a set of individual variants into a common platform representation. For example, reverse engineering a set of individual variants into a Software Product Line (SPL) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}publications#splc13">[SPLC'13]</a><a href="{{site.baseurl}}publications#sosym16">[SoSyM'16]</a>.</li>
	<li>Supporting ad hoc development of variants (clone and own) as well as their subsequent maintenance <a href="{{site.baseurl}}publications#icsme14_2">[ICSME'14]</a>.</li>
	<li>Supporting the evolution of a set of variants and their individual features <a href="{{site.baseurl}}publications#sst15">[SST'15]</a>.</li>
	<li>Replacing existing revision control systems (SVN, Git, etc.) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}publications#icse16">[ICSE'16]</a>.</li>
	</ul>
